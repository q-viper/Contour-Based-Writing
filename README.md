# Contour Based Visually Writing System
**Once a kid from a mountains was tired of ink pens and he thought to write in canvas by just moving fingers in front of camera**. 

Well above line is just a joke. This porject is under developing stage and I myself is wondering what features can I add next? I get feedbacks from people on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qramkrishna/) and I am always grateful for the support I get. Many people have supported this project from [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6699919193124548608/).

## Introduction
The primary focus of this project is to perform a Gesture Based Writing System(but it is still working by contours). But I have not used Gesture recognition here. In fact until the [5th version](https://q-viper.github.io/2020/08/28/gesture-based-visually-writing-system-web-app/) of this project I have not added gesture recognition scheme. Hence the correct name is Contour Based Writing System. The entire concepts of working system can be clearly understood by reading the [blog of first version](https://q-viper.github.io/2020/08/01/gesture-based-visually-writing-system-using-opencv-and-python/) where I have tried to explain theoritical concepts and all the working ideas. If you have any ideas or thoughts about the system please, contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramkrishna-acharya-91a217183/). 

## Requirements
* OpenCv >=4.1.1
* Imutils >=0.5.3
* PyTesseract

If you are running this system after installation, then try to install libraries on virtual environment. Follow the official documentation of each library for easy installation.

## Implementation
Until 5th version, the system is only python code and there is nothing like implementation. However I have made it Web based. But this web application is runnable locally only.
This is the [notebook](https://github.com/q-viper/Contour-Based-Writing/blob/master/Contour%20Based%20Writing-%20New%20VUI%2C%20Adding%20Slider%2C%20More%20Colors%2C%20New%20Animation%20and%20Code%20Optimization.ipynb) I recommend to view.
